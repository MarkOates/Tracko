My official entry to the TINS 2024 Game Jam


## How to Play

Use only the keyboards's ARROW KEYS, SPACEBAR, and ENTER to play.

Your goal is to line up the tracks to get the train from the start to the end, before the train
crashes!

### During Gameplay
- Move the cursor with the ARROW KEYS.
- Press SPACEBAR to either 1) reveal a hidden piece or 2) swap the revealed piece with your "swap tile".
- If you win or lose, press ENTER to continue.

You cannot pause or exit gameplay. If you want to quit the game you can close the window or SHIFT+ESC.

I hope the game runs smoothly for you.  All levels are are unlocked at start, so you can play any one without having to beat prior ones.


## AI

Some AI was used during the production of this game, including Midjourney for
background textures and the background during gameplay. Some assistance from
ChatGPT was used, mostly for rubber ducking, but no generated code was copied.


## Missed Rules

Unfortunately, I was not able to get the quadratic formula OR a custom paint job feature. I was going to be cool, I swear. ;)  My idea for the quadratic was to add a bouncing animation on the train, and customizable train colors for the paint job. I started with a class for the latter, but it the feature ultimately didn't make it to production due to time constraints.

Again, I hope you enjoy the game!  Thanks for playing :)
